The entire mid-upper level management was changed due to which the year end assessment suffered a huge blow. Deserving employees were given peanuts which led to a lot of them resigning. Some projects have a very good ambience and work environment but there are some which have a very bad management. The lead continuously harrases the subordinates and even abuses them. People are expected to work for 14-15 hrs without work from home and work gets piled up even after that. The lead doesn't participate and leaves his work for others to do. Micromanagement is rampant. You would get vacation balance but applying for a vacation is a headache. Accenture is a good company but you would be working for a project first and then for Accenture.
