Ideas are valued. Hyderabad facilities are world class and we'll maintained.,Starting with 2017 end. The entire mid-upper level management was changed due to which the year end assessment suffered a huge blow. Deserving employees were given peanuts which led to a lot of them resigning. Some projects have a very good ambience and work environment but there are some which have a very bad management. The lead continuously harrases the subordinates and even abuses them. People are expected to work for 14-15 hrs without work from home and work gets piled up even after that. The lead doesn't participate and leaves his work for others to do. Micromanagement is rampant. You would get vacation balance but applying for a vacation is a headache. Accenture is a good company but you would be working for a project first and then for Accenture. Choose your projects wisely.,"Take some interest in what the junior level employees feel in a project. They are the backbone of the company, the working class.

In other words, you know there is light at end of the tunnel. In smaller companies, if you get stuck in bad project, you may be stuck without other options","- It's not a company to enhance technical skills. You may not be able to build core competence in any specific domain/technology. So, I wouldn't recommend to freshers.- Compensation is okay but past couple of years, the % increment is falling down to official 0% for many in 2017.- Worst part is performance appraisal process which runs from Sep-Aug. If your project tenure gets over in Feb/March and you change project, then even if you do well in new project for rest of the appraisal period, there is a high chance of you coming in bottom grade which would eventually mean you will be thrown out of the company.- Location stability is a matter of luck otherwise you will be required to move to different city/location if you are on bench for more than a month. They will give you 3 project options - take it or leave the company- Contrary to smaller companies where you are valued for your knowledge of product, in Accenture, you're valued as long as you're in the project. Once project gets over and you're on bench, then no value.","The new performance system is old product in new package. The pain of force fitting bottom grade is still there.
